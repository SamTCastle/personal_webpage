	abstract = {Citizen feedback on the implementation of social welfare schemes can help fine tune their design, understand problems, and assess the benefits and impact from these schemes. Such feedback loops however are singularly missing in most schemes in India, and are conveyed only indirectly via civil society and social audit organisations that try to serve as a bridge between citizens and the government. We leverage the deep penetration of mobile phones in India to design a suite of {IVR} (Interactive Voice Response) tools that can help capture community perceptions, improve awareness of the people, and verify official records directly by the beneficiaries themselves. In the context of a rural employment guarantee scheme, we evaluate these tools in a few villages in the state of Haryana and demonstrate that there is good scope for using {IVR} tools to serve as a citizen engagement channel for welfare schemes. Our contribution lies in outlining several use-cases for technology interventions, and uncovering nuances that should be addressed if such systems are integrated into the implementation of social welfare schemes.},

	abstract = {Bangladesh is now one of the world leaders in using telecommunication (mainly phone) for poverty alleviation. Village Pay Phone ({VPP}) Program - an {NGO} led initiative has been hailed as one of the first program to use telephone for poverty alleviation (2003). The success of this program led to low-income entrepreneur both in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh to take similar kind of initiative. Studies on {VPP} program show it can reduce poverty in rural areas. This paper focuses on the performance of the enterprises, which are not in {VPP} program. We conclude that these initiatives are equally effective in alleviating poverty},

	abstract = {Media uploads and downloads, even those on the order of a few hundred kilobytes, commonly fail when attempted over lossy, low-bandwidth, and high latency connections. These conditions, which are common for networks in rural, resource-poor areas, result in the inability for residents of these areas to fully participate in the modern Internet. We study traffic traces collected from two networks and find high locality of interest as well as poor performance for Internet media. We also find that users often abort uploads due to network performance. Given that media content produced by local users is often heavily consumed by local users, we propose {VillageCache}, a system which allows for appropriate local transformation and redistribution of media uploaded through an Internet cache. We build {VillageCache} and find it successfully delivers cached media, providing an orders of magnitude improvement in file transfer performance, bandwidth reduction, and the virtual elimination of video stalls in the face of poor network connectivity. Caches with upload capabilities placed at the edge of poorly-connected networks will enable users to produce and consume media-rich content while mitigating the constraints present in under-resourced networks.},

	abstract = {{CGNet} Swara is a voice-based platform for citizen journalism, launched in rural India in 2010. Since then, {CGNet} Swara has logged over 575,000 phone calls, over 6,900 published stories, and 287 reports of specific problems that were solved via the system. In this paper, we characterize the ongoing impact of {CGNet} Swara using a mixed-methods approach that includes 70 interviews with contributors, listeners, moderators, journalists, officials, and other actors. Our analysis also draws on the content of published posts, two focus groups, and a 9-day field immersion. Our results highlight personal narratives of the transformative benefits {CGNet} Swara has brought to rural communities. While the resolution of grievances is the most visible impact, we also uncover a diverse portfolio of other impacts connected to contributing and listening to the platform, as well as opportunities to further enhance impact. Our work contributes to the dialogue surrounding the impact of {ICTD} projects, especially those that span multiple years.},

	abstract = {The count of mobile Internet users in India has been growing at a rate of 27\% annually and is expected to reach 300M by 2017. There is however limited understanding of whether this rapid growth is happening while also ensuring that good quality of service is provided to users. To find out, we deployed a measurement framework in 20 rural, semi-urban, and urban sites in North India and probed four leading 2G and 3G telecom providers to measure performance metrics such as availability, throughput and latency. We also observed some design and configuration aspects of cellular networks that affect the quality of service perceived by users. Our results point to many instances where misconfigurations or inadequate provisioning or poor monitoring of cellular networks led to significantly low performance provided to users. We are now using these results to argue for more robust {QoS} regulation in the country, and show how the current regulations for 2G and 3G services are not sufficient to hold providers accountable for the quality of service provided by them.},

Does it matter how the information is conveyed? This paper presents findings from a randomized field experiment that evaluates the impact of a Short Message Service ({SMS}) sexual health counseling service on individuals' knowledge and behavior in an urban informal settlement of Nairobi, Kenya. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions which tested different mechanisms through which technology-enabled information provision could work to alter sexual behavior: (1) information gap reduction, (2) personalization and (3) social cues. The evidence suggests that personalizing the information and providing signals about how other people in the community are behaving can dramatically minimize sexual health risk, compared to simply reducing the information gap. Additionally, individuals receiving generic, non-personalized health information were more likely to engage in risky behavior compared to their counterparts.},

	abstract = {Wireless {ISPs} ({WISPs}) are one of the primary means of delivering broadband Internet access to rural and underserved areas of the world. However, {WISP} operators often struggle to maintain let alone grow their operations. We set out both to understand what challenges {WISP} operators face and to develop new approaches to help them in managing their networks. First, we present a study we conducted of operating {WISPs} to understand what barriers they face. Second, we describe our experiences building and using a software system for {WISP} management, and a new {WISP} we have built from the ground up using that system. We found that {WISPs} appear to reach natural scaling limits, and that despite excitement in the networking community about the promise of Software Defined Networking ({SDN}) in new environments, more mundane functionality like subscriber management provides much of the actual benefit to {WISPs}.},
